1) Disable "real time protection" in "virus & threat protection settings". 
   (Note: Only in windows 10. For others, disable protection settings)
2) Run "xxx_activator.cmd" file as administrator.
3) Wait for a while, your files will take some time to compile & after that a message
   will prompt in the middle as "Product activation successful".
4) Now, check the activation. If not working then, restart the pc in order to apply changes.
